BHN1 — BHN1 Task 3: Project Report
Data Analytics Capstone — D502

PRFA — BHN1

Task Overview

Competencies
    4123.1.1 : Capstone
        The learner integrates and synthesizes competencies from across the degree program, thereby demonstrating the ability to participate in and contribute value to the chosen professional field.

Introduction:

    Before starting this task, ensure that Tasks 1 and 2 have a passing score. If Task 1 or 2 has not yet passed, your Task 3 submission will be returned without evaluation.

    In this task, you will complete your capstone by writing a report that summarizes your data analytics project, including an overview of the project, a discussion of how the execution of your project differed from your plan, a discussion of your project methodology, and an evaluation of your project results. You will also submit a recorded summary of your project.
    

Requirements:

    Your submission must represent your original work and understanding of the course material. Most performance assessment submissions are automatically scanned through the WGU similarity checker. Students are strongly encouraged to wait for the similarity report to generate after uploading their work and then review it to ensure Academic Authenticity guidelines are met before submitting the file for evaluation. See Understanding Similarity Reports for more information.  

    Grammarly Note: 
    Professional Communication will be automatically assessed through Grammarly for Education in most performance assessments before a student submits work for evaluation. Students are strongly encouraged to review the Grammarly for Education feedback prior to submitting work for evaluation, as the overall submission will not pass without this aspect passing. See Use Grammarly for Education Effectively for more information.  

    Microsoft Files Note: 
    Write your paper in Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx) unless another Microsoft product, or pdf, is specified in the task directions. Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc.  All supporting documentation, such as screenshots and proof of experience, should be collected in a pdf file and submitted separately from the main file. For more information, please see Computer System and Technology Requirements.  

    You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.
